                <h2 >ACE LAB BERKELEY</h2>
                <p>At Berkeley I've started my career in Bioengineering but always aimed to continue with my Computer Science interests</p>
                <p>Because of that I've taken data structures, Front End and data analytics classes. I also had to opportunity to join a research team in the
                    CS Department at Berkeley to create a cheating detection system for online 
                    computer science test taking.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With the pandemic, students and teachers were introduced to new modalities for learning and testing</p>
                <p>But it was hard to track how much a student was actually learning with unilimited access to online resources while test taking</p>
                <p>Because of that this teams looks to make the process fair introducing algorithms to flag and detect students who cheated. 
                If this project is sucessful it will facilitate online study and will make Berkeley CS courses acessible for anybody to take online.
